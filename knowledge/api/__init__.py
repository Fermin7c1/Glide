"""The coach's query API over the knowledge layer: the live knowledge block for callouts, the Claude tools for
questions and reviews, and the grounding check of the coach's FACTS lines.

The LLM narrates; this module knows and computes. Every result is a compact JSON-serialisable dict of facts and
numbers with a "facts" list of the ids behind them. Nothing here writes to kb.db and nothing raises to the coach.

  pack = KnowledgePack(kb, rxp=None, geo=None)
      kb    store.KB, a path, or None (missing or unloadable: pack.ok is False, every call answers
            {"unavailable": reason} and the coach runs as it did before the knowledge layer)
      rxp   RestedXP settings of the character; they decide which steps exist and how RXP numbers them:
            ssf, group_quests, hardcore, dungeons. Default DEFAULT_RXP (solo self-found, group quests on: how
            the player's characters are set up in RestedXP's SavedVariables)
      geo   optional companion geo.Geo, for directions like "Kharanos, near Innkeeper Belm, 80 yd north"
  ctx = pack.context(summary, coach_flags=None, triggers=None, book=None, recent=None, now=None, me=None)
      the live context of one coach turn: GameState.summary(), the player, the resolved guide key / route /
      step, muted commentary types, companion bookkeeping (deaths, mount, group, step visits), the recent coach
      log. Tools and the block take it.
  pack.block(ctx, triggers=None)   the "knowledge" block for live callouts (<= BLOCK_TOKENS, measured len/4)
  pack.panel(summary=None)         {"why", "pace"} for the dashboard, from the last block (never computes)
  pack.decay_info(quest_id, level) turnin_decay_soon facts (one cached row per quest; cheap on any thread)
  pack.verify_facts(ids)           (known, unknown): grounding check of a FACTS line
  pack.status()                    KB status for the companion's startup line
  TOOLS / tool_definitions()       the Messages API "tools" list
  dispatch(name, args, ctx)        one tool's result dict (time-budgeted, trimmed to RESULT_TOKENS, never raises)

Guide and step resolution. The live G page carries RestedXP's own guide name (zero-padded and cut to 40 bytes:
'05-11 Dun Morogh') and its group ('RestedXP Forever Guide (A)'); rxp_guide.key is 'group||name' with the
unpadded name. GuideResolver normalises both forms (sources/live_logs.Guides: rxp_parser.affix_name, zero padding,
the 40-byte cut), prefers the page's group, the character's faction and non-dungeon guides, and caches. The live
step number (core `st`) is RestedXP's number among the steps it keeps for these settings: route.rxp_to_idx (the
mapping route.brief_for_rxp_step uses) turns it into the guide's step idx. When the live S0 page lists quests the
mapped step does not touch, the nearest step within 6 numbers that touches them wins.

Fact ids: q:<quest> c:<creature> i:<item> p:<param key> h:<heuristic id> s:<guide name or key>/<step idx>
poi:<kind>:<id> g:<glossary term>. verify_facts() accepts one only when the row exists and is usable.

Modules: pack (KnowledgePack, a facade over resolve, lookup, panel, extras and facts), context (Ctx), guides
(guide and player resolution), results (budgets, trimming, fact ids), reasons (why codes in words), community
(community notes), navigation (walking and flying routes), tools (the Claude tools and dispatch), values (small
shared helpers), _layer (the defensive imports).
