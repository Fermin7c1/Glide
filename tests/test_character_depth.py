"""A character that stays itself (Phase 2 of the coach's social side): a new character gets sample lines and its own
story threads (once, in the background), and lines the player answered become favourites; they anchor every call as
"HOW YOU SOUND", with its story threads, who the player is to it (ROLE) and the scene being played (SCENE); phrases it
keeps repeating are named to rest; greetings mention its own life while the player was away.

Run: python3 tests/test_character_depth.py   (prints OK)
