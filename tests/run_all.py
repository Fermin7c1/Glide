                                      since REF. The full run stays the check before a commit, and CI runs it
    py -3 tests/run_all.py --list     which tests would run, in the order they start, and run none
    py -3 tests/run_all.py --smoke    the report-only checks on the player's real data instead (tests/**/smoke_*.py,
                                      see tests/kb/smoke.py): they print findings and never fail the run

A test passes with exit code 0. One that cannot run here (no data/kb.db, no node, no browser, ...) prints
"SKIP: <reason>" and exits with SKIP_EXIT (77): the summary lists it apart from the passes and the failures.
tests/golden holds the golden-master probes, run by tests/test_golden.py and golden.py (no test_*.py there).

In parallel, the longest tests start first, by how long each took in this machine's earlier runs (tests/.timings.json,
not committed; without it the hand-kept _HEAVY list). The few the run's length hangs on (at least half as long as the
longest) run at normal priority and the rest a step below, with up to 2 * -j tests at once: a short test takes a core
the moment a long one leaves it idle, and never slows the long ones down. (Measured on a 4-core Linux box, -j 4: 33.4
s with the old fixed order and -j tests at once, 24.7 s longest-first with priority, 23.4 s with 2 * -j at once.)
