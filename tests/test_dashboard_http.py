"""The engine's HTTP server keeps other web pages out: a request naming another host (DNS rebinding) gets 403; with
a token, a POST (or /api/state, GET /memory) without it gets 403, including a cross-site form's text/plain body that
happens to be valid JSON; the page, the event stream and static files need no token; the served page carries the
token; the desktop window opens only http(s) links outside. The routes are one table (dashboard.serve's own plus
App.http_routes): a path matches exactly with its query parsed (/xph?x answers, /modelsfoo doesn't), another method
on a known path answers 405, bodies are parsed once, and the GETs that run something (/calibrate, /models?refresh=1)
need the token too. Also the hub: a client that falls behind is dropped
and its stream ends; a message is either in a new client's init or in its queue; the first-client hook runs once
(and so the app hears "Glide voice ready.").

Run: python3 tests/test_dashboard_http.py   (prints OK)
