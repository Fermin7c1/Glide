"""The desktop app's main process (the tests' shared compile, desktop_ts.py) copied into a temp folder and run under
Node without Electron (desktop_main_check.cjs): a Python that can't be launched leaves the coach "crashed" with the reason and lets the app
quit (it used to hang in "starting" and stop() never returned); a changed engine home gets the engine code when the
coach starts; code folders Glide didn't install are never deleted; an unreadable config.json is never saved over."""
