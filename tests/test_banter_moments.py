"""The character feels there with the player (banter.py, persona.py): it reacts to moments (deaths and death streaks,
level-ups, close calls, elite kills, new zones), keeps a diary of them across sessions and recalls it, greets them at a
login and says goodbye when the game goes away, has a mood that moments push and time settles, asks for a varied shape
and names its overused openers, talks sooner in downtime and where the player answers, remembers what it made up about
itself (LORE) under its name (NAME) so "bring back <name>" restores it, and delivers each line with its TONE.

Run: python3 tests/test_banter_moments.py   (prints OK)
