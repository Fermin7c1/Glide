"""The bond's storage (memory.py): coach_bond.json beside coach_memory.json, so an older engine (which keeps only its
note kinds and keys) never loses it; "rapport" notes saved as facts flagged "rapport" (older engines keep them);
unknown note kinds and keys written back as they were; every part of a hand-edited or broken file checked (a bad
entry dropped, never a crash at start or in a coach call); zones remembered apart from the capped diary; "forget
everything" forgets the history too; character names in any script; a Character edited in Settings never takes
another character's lore.

Run: python3 tests/test_memory_bond.py   (prints OK)
