"""The engine's event stream is typed once (desktop/src/shared/engine.ts) for both UIs: the desktop renderer reads it
through those types, and the dashboard (companion/static/dashboard.js, // @ts-check) is checked against them by
desktop/tsconfig.dashboard.json in npm run build. Here the types are checked against the engine: every top-level key
of a real state (tests/golden/fixtures/dashboard_init.json) is declared and nothing declared is gone, and every
message field the engine sets (the fixture's, and the ones coach.py adds) is a CoachMessage field."""
