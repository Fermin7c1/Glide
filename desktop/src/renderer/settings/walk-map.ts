It's built once, after install, in the background at the lowest priority so the game keeps its frame rate. It takes about an hour per continent, starting with the one you're on, and picks up where it left off if you close Glide. Game patches don't rebuild it. When a newer Glide can make a better one, this panel and the Status page say so; rebuilding is up to you.</small></div>
