"""Asides: while the coach plays a character (persona.py) it speaks up unprompted, in character, like someone who is
there with the player. Mostly because something happened (a moment: a death or a death streak, a level-up, a close
call, an elite or rare kill, a new zone, a long grind, a flight), at a login (a greeting that picks up from last time)
and when the game goes away (a goodbye); between moments now and then (about every banter_minutes, sooner in
downtime: flying, dead, eating or drinking). Only in a calm moment; the model may decline (SKIP).

What makes it organic:
- the diary (Memory.diary): the moments shared, kept across sessions, for callbacks ("ye haven't died since Westfall");
- the mood: the character's state, pushed by moments and settling with time ("grumpy after three deaths"), on every
  request's stay-in-character line;
- variety: each aside asks for a shape (a grunt, a quip, a short story, a callback, a follow-up to its own last line, a
  question...) and names the openers and endings it has been overusing;
- learning when the player likes to talk: the asides answered per activity (Memory.bond's by_activity) make the timer
  shorter where they chat and longer where they don't.

The bond (Memory.bond: hours together, sessions, asides answered) sets the stage (new -> old friends) and reflection
learns "rapport" notes from how the player reacts. Answering an aside starts a chat (in_chat, CHAT_NOTE) that goes on
while the player does. "BANTER: less / more / off / on" in a reply sets banter_minutes or banter. One of the coach
thread's tickers (Coach._loop calls tick about once a second; Coach.push hands every frame to observe)."""
