"""The coach's long-term memory of the player: coach_memory.json in memory_dir().

What the player tells or teaches the coach outlives the session: preferences about how to be coached, goals, standing
requests, corrections of the coach's mistakes, and facts about the player and their playstyle. Each note:

    {"id": 7, "kind": "preference", "text": "Wants callouts under 10 words.", "source": "player" | "coach" |
     "reflection" | "mark", "created": <unix>, "updated": <unix>, "pinned": false, "used": 3}

Notes come from the player ("remember that ...", "from now on ...", the app's Memory page), from the coach's
memory_remember tool, from "/glide mark <note>" feedback, and from reflection: now and then the deep model reviews the
recent conversation and feedback against the notes and proposes additions, rewrites and removals (Coach.reflect).

Where it lives (memory_dir): GLIDE_MEMORY_DIR when set, else %APPDATA%\\Glide\\memory on Windows (~/.glide/memory
elsewhere): outside the app's install folder and the engine home, so it survives app updates, reinstalls, a moved
engine home and the plain start-glide.cmd companion alike. A dated copy is kept once a day (the last 14).

block() is the prompt section every coach call carries (a system block of its own, so it stays in the prompt cache
until a note changes). Pure stdlib; thread-safe; a missing or broken file starts an empty memory.

The bond with the player (banter.py: hours together, sessions, how the asides went, the diary of shared moments, the
zones visited together, the characters played with their lore) lives beside it in coach_bond.json, a file older
engines never read or write, so going back to an older version keeps it. "rapport" notes are written to
coach_memory.json as kind "fact" with "rapport": true (older engines keep and show them as facts), and notes of a kind
or top-level keys this engine doesn't know are written back as they were.
