# The Glide strip (addon → engine)

Generated from `companion/strip_spec.py` by `python companion/strip_spec.py --write`; edit the registry, not this file. This is the definition of interface #1 in `docs/REFACTOR-CONTRACTS.md`: keys, pages and events keep their meaning once sent (they are also stored in `data/live/*.jsonl`); new ones are fine.

## Frame

The addon draws a grid of cells at the top-left corner of the game window (Strip.lua), in physical pixels:
`cols` x `2 * rows` cells of `cell` px (GlideLinkDB, defaults 96 x 8 and 3 px), then three gauges.

- **Markers.** Cell 0 is magenta (255, 0, 255). Cell 1 is yellow (255, 255, 0) for the binary strip (addon
  0.14.1 and later), cyan (0, 255, 255) for the old 6-bit strip. Each frame's marker cells also set the on/off
  threshold per colour channel, so the read follows HDR or other processing as it changes.
- **Cells.** Every 6-bit symbol is drawn as two cells, three bits each (red, green, blue; fully off or fully on),
  high bits first. (The old 6-bit strip drew one cell per symbol, two bits per channel at levels 0/85/170/255;
  the engine still reads it, Windows Auto HDR breaks it.)
- **Frame.** Bytes `[version][seq][len hi][len lo][payload ...][fletcher16 hi][fletcher16 lo]`, zero-padded to a
  multiple of 3; every 3 bytes are four symbols. `version` is PROTO = 1; `seq` counts frames mod 256; the
  Fletcher-16 sum covers the bytes before it. Capacity: `(cols * rows - 2) // 4 * 3` bytes, 6 of them framing
  (567 payload bytes at the defaults). Codec.lua encodes, companion/protocol.py decodes; they are twins.
- **Payload.** UTF-8 text `core|page`: the core (every frame), a `|`, then one page (or nothing). Both are
  `key=value` pairs joined by `;`. Values never hold `;`, `=`, `|` or line breaks (the addon replaces them).
  A page starts with `pg=<id>;` and is at most 124 bytes with it; a page that doesn't fit the room the core leaves
  waits for a later frame instead of being cut. Pages that changed go first, then the rest in turn.
- **Lists** spread over numbered pages (`Q0`, `Q1`, ...; at most 20). Entries are joined by `,`, fields inside an
  entry by `:`. The engine takes a list only once it has all its chunks and their joined text matches the list's
  hash (protocol.list_hash, State.lua ns.Hash: h = (h * 31 + byte) mod 65521 over the UTF-8 bytes). Quest, buff
  and gear lists carry their page count and hash in the core (`qn`/`qh`, ...); the other lists carry them on every
  page (`n`, `h`).
- **Ring events.** The core's `e1`..`e3` repeat the last three events, newest first, as `id:kind:arg` (arg cleaned,
  at most 40 bytes), so a missed frame loses nothing. Ids count up from 1 each UI load; the engine takes ids above
  the highest it has seen and treats a ring all below it as a restart (UI reload, relog).
- **Gauges.** Under the grid, three 200 x 3 px StatusBars: player health (green), player power (blue), target
  health (red). Forever hides these numbers from addons (secret values), but a StatusBar still shows them, so the
  engine measures the fill (core `gk` says which bars hold a real value).
- **Versions.** The engine wants the addon version it ships with (core `gv`, from the TOC); any other version asks
  the player to update the addon and restart WoW (companion/versions.py).
